This folder represents the first draft for my portfolio website that I create for my Experience and Interaction Tools class (Fall 2020). 
The assignment for this class consisted of using HTML and CSS to create a website of our choice to practice our skills. As a result, this 
first draft is limited to the knowledge I had at that time when I was first applying my HTML and CSS skills.
