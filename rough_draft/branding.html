            <h1>Branding</h1>
            <p>
                As a student at Northeastern Univeristy, I have had various opportunities to practice capturing the branding identity of entities. This practice has helped me grow as a graphic design. I have learned how to take an existing brand and revamp the unique characteristics through typography and illustrations.

                            During Spring 2020, I was an assistant graphic designer for the Latinx Student Cultural Center at Northeastern University. I was assigned to design the logo for the Annual Senior Banquet pamphlet. Unfortunately, due to COVID-19, the banquet was canceled.
                            Despite the missed opportunity of sharing my work, I still gained the experience of designing a logo for an event. The designs on the left are the two final versions that I would have presented to the staff of the Latinx center.                    
                            The top version uses text of 100% opacity. This allowed me to focus on the negative space of the logo and determine how to overlap text without too much distraction or confusion from the viewer.
                            The bottom version uses text that's not 100% opacity. This allowed the top layer text to be informed by the logo as the logo had its own illustrative decorations. This version focused on staying within the circular shape of the logo to stay consistent with the logo's text.

                            I started my position as the Media Specialist in the Animation Club at Northeastern University during Fall 2020. The responsibilities of my position include designing the posters for club events so that they can appear on the club's social media.
                            The club has its own branding identity of playfulness and vibrancy. I take this into account when deciding what illustrations to include in the posters other than the club's mascot. The posters' appearances benefit from minimalist illustrations as seen on the right as well as from negative space and various font sizes in order to make different sections easier to read.
