            <h1>Catalog Website</h1>
            <p>
                For one of my design classes at Northeastern University in Fall 2020, I was part of a group project in which we were assigned to create a website cataloging an object of our choosing. My group decided on creating a catalog of backpacks. Below shows the work from the group collaboration and my individual work on the assignment.

                            My group used the application Atom to collaborate on the coding of the homepage of our website. We used HTML and CSS to construct the webpages and used a minimalist approach for our design.

                            The images to the left showcase the end result of the homepage and the simplistic design approach we took. We avoided adding a navigation bar and added a hover feature on the images to imply that more information can be seen on other pages about each backpack.

                            The website consisted of 4 backpacks that were attributed to the names of the group members. Each group member was responsible for constructing the webpage of their back. Using HTML and CSS, I was able to mimic the minimalistic style of the homepage, such as adding a single navigation bar and centering the text, using negative space to enforce our chosen simplistic style.â€‹
