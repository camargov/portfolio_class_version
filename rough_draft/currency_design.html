            <h1>Currency Design</h1>
            <p>
                For one of my design classes at Northeastern University in Fall 2019, I was given the project to design a currency of my choosing. I decided on redesigning the U.S. $100 bill as a way to experiment with line expression and the informing power of negative space.

                            I experimented with fluid and strict lines to determine which best represented the symbol of the statue of liberty in the context of an American dollar bill. This led me to separate static and fluid lines to each side of the currency and attaching an American figure to emphasize the expression of these lines.
                            Through ideation, I also realized that zooming in on the American figures allowed for clear visuals of individual lines which helped to inform the meaning behind each side of the currency.  
                            Once I had figured out the visuals of the currency, the next step was to determine what phrases to add which lead to some research on each American figure and the words they are known for.

                            Once I had decided on my final designs, I used black pen and paint to add dimensions and shadows. This allowed for a variety of repetitive lines as they were expressed in different weights from the medium they were drawn in.
                            Overall this design demonstrated the conflicting sentiments of the United States. The country's prosperity is represented as fluid lines reflecting a positive perspective while strict lines represent the harsh reality of social issues that the country faces.                                     â€‹
